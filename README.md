## Overview

SkiWise is an intelligent ski resort recommendation tool built for skiers and snowboarders planning trips in Colorado. The application helps users find the most optimal resorts based on a personalized combination of preferences such as:

- Starting location  
- Budget per person  
- Maximum travel time  
- Minimum fresh powder  
- Pass type (Ikon, Epic, both, or neither)  
- Driving experience level  

The app uses real-time weather and traffic data to recommend the **top 3 resorts** using a weighted optimization model.
