## Overview
This project uses **Linear Programming (LP)** to rank and select the top ski resorts based on multiple factors:
- **Cost per person**
- **Travel time**
- **Snowfall conditions** (experimental)

### **Functionality**
- The LP model considers **user-defined constraints** (budget, time, snowfall) and finds the top 3 resorts that maximize the weighted score.
- Outputs the selected resorts along with detailed information on cost, travel time, and scores.

---

## **Prerequisites**

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- Required libraries:
  - `math` â†’ For rounding operations

---

### **Sample Output**
